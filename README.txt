* This is an Arduino library for the MLX90614 temperature sensor                                   *
****************************************************************************************************

This library was written to enable remote sensing of the temperature of the rotors of outrunner
style brushless DC motors used in remotely piloted aircraft, for the purpose of real time data 
logging and air to ground telemetry.

These sensors use the SMB bus protocol to communicate. This is similar though not identical to 
the I2C bus. There is enough similarity to enable the Arduino standard Wire library to communicate
with the device, however not all features can be implemented, for example it is not possible to 
read the flags register with standard Wire functions. 2 pins are required to interface the device 
to an Arduino - the SDA and SCL lines.

Written by John Fitter, Eagle Air Australia p/l. and inspired by a library written
by Adafruit Industries.

Download the distribution package and decompress it.
Rename the uncompressed folder MLX90614. 
Check that the MLX90614 folder contains the following files;

MLX90614.cpp
MLX90614.h
MLX90614.chm
Crc8.cpp
Crc8.h
property.h

Place the MLX90614 library folder your arduinosketchfolder/libraries/ folder. You may need to 
create the libraries subfolder if its your first library.
Restart the IDE.

MLX90614.chm contains the documentation for the classes.
